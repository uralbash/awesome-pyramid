  Framework](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041900.do) -
  In this Web Applications with Python and the Pyramid Framework training
  course, expert author Paul Everitt will teach you about the features needed
  for Python web development, as well as Pyramid's unique features. This
  course is designed for users that already have a basic knowledge of Python.

  You will start by learning about single file web apps, templating, and
  multiple routes and views. From there, Paul will teach you about MyApp
  Python package, views and routes, and templating and static assets. This
  video tutorial also covers forms, databases, and sessions, authentication
  and authorization, and JSON. Finally, you will learn about extensibility,
  including custom configuration settings, extending and overriding, and
  custom view predicates.

  Once you have completed this computer based training course, you will have
  gained a basic understanding of the features needed for Python web
  development and the features unique to Pyramid.
